    <h1>The history of token distribution models and their impact</h1>
    <p>
        It is no secret that cryptocurrencies have gained prominent popularity since 2009.  With a lot of investors gaining interest , it is clear that tokenomics will be a word on most people's lips. Here an overview on the history of token distribution models and their impact. 
    </p>
    <p>Before giving the overview of the token distribution model , I thought it would be better if I first understood what the term tokenomics meant…</p>
    <p>Tokenomics <em>(portmanteau)</em>: 
        A word blending the sounds and combining the meaning of two other words, in this case token and economics.
        This term is used to describe the governance of crypto assets and all the mechanics of how these assets work and/or psychological or behavioral forces that could affect their value in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>January 3 2009 marks the official birthday of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, Bitcoin! 
        Satosh Nakomoto engineered Bitcoin's mining system to distribute new token supply to the supporters of the network. Nakomoto's design enabled the network participants to earn bitcoin for their work in supporting consensus, his goal was to bring as many people into the network as possible to ensure a sufficiently large distribution of stakeholders. This design is also referred to as “Fair Launch”, meaning that the token is not allocated privately prior to making it public. They are also governed  by the entire community. Other examples of cryptocurrencies that follow this design(mining) are YFL and Dogecoin. </p>
    <p>The impact mining has is a lot of physical electronic waste, high voltage of electricity usage. Typically the amount of power used in a single Bitcoin transaction is well over 2,2 kilowatt hours. This amount of electricity can power a typical US household for 78 days or rather 2 months and +-3 weeks. Now bearing mind that in some countries like the USA
        Burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, worsening climate change. </p>
    <p>Contrary to mining the crypto space was introduced to ICO (initial coin offering) these tokens are pre-mined. The first to take advantage of this was Mastercoin in July 2013. In 2014 July Ethereum raised money with a token sale , raising about 31,000 BTC or approximately $18.3 million at that time. Then in 2017 ICO gained popularity , there were at least 18 websites tracking ICOs before mid-year. Now get this, in May of 2017 the new website Brave generated about $35 million in under 30 seconds. Then Kik(Canadian messaging app) followed and a few more after that. ICO coin sales worth $2.3 billion had been conducted during the year, more than ten times as much as in all of 2016.  However with these prons  came some cons
        Where some projects were frauds and others simply became extinct. Overall many teams moved towards more regulated approaches, which included SAFTs(simple agreement for future tokens).  
    </p>
    <p> A new phenomenon IEO (initial Exchange Offering) launched October 31 2019 and IDO (initial DEX Offering), these models with unique improvements from ICO and IPO. as they originally came out as  decentralized ,more secure and more accessible. Binance Launchpad is the pioneering IEO platform that became mainstream in 2019. With many successful IEOs, such as BitTorrent, Celer Network and Fetch AI just to name a few. </p>

        <b>Dutch Auction, as defined by Investopedia, “is a public offering auction structure in which the price of the offering is set after taking in all bids to determine the highest price at which the total offering can be sold. In this type of auction, investors place a bid for the amount they are willing to buy in terms of quantity and price.”</b>
         It is one of the token models available in the crypto-world.With Dutch auction,a participant may place bids for a number of tokens they are interested in buying and they provide the  maximum amount they want to pay for a token. Furthermore, as a participant you are guaranteed an allocation if the you willing to pay is above the clearing price.

    <p>Now imagine being able to generate more crypto with crypto . Well this is basically what yield farmers do. While being discreet about their complicated strategies , they move their crytos around trying to chase the highest return.  
        While yield farming is one of the ways to maximize your return , it goes without saying that even the loss can be high, especially if you don't know what you are doing. One known risk in DeFi are smart contracts  as they may contain bugs. Whether or not the protocols are developed by small teams with limited budget or even by reputable auditing firms, vulnerabilities and bugs are consistently discovered. This due to the immutable nature of blockchain . Just in case you want to take a walk on wild side, here are some of the platforms yield farmers use: 
        <ol>
        <li>Compound Finance </li>
        <li>MakerDAO</li>
        <li>Synthetix</li>
        <li>Aave</li>
        <li>Uniswap</li>
        </ol>  
    </p>
    <p> <em>With what has already been launched in the crypto space I am fascinated to see what the DeFi revolution brings next.</em></p>
