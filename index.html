        <h1>The history of token distribution models and their impact</h1>
    <p>
        It is no secret that cryptocurrencies have gained prominent popularity since 2009.  With a lot of investors gaining interest , it is clear that tokenomics will be a word on most people's lips. Here is an overview on the history of token distribution models and their impact. 
    </p>
    <p>Before giving the overview of the token distribution model , I thought it would be better if I first understood what the term tokenomics meant…</p>
    <p>Tokenomics <em>(portmanteau)</em>: 
        A word blending the sounds and combining the meaning of two other words, in this case token and economics.
        This term is used to describe the governance of crypto assets and all the mechanics of how these assets work and/or psychological or behavioral forces that could affect their value in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>January 3 2009 marks the official birthday of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, Bitcoin! 
        Satosh Nakomoto engineered Bitcoin's mining system to distribute new token supply to the supporters of the network. Nakomoto's design enabled the network participants to earn bitcoin for their work in supporting consensus, his goal was to bring as many people into the network as possible to ensure a sufficiently large distribution of stakeholders. This design is also referred to as “Fair Launch'', meaning that the token is not allocated privately prior to making it public. They are also governed  by the entire community. Other examples of cryptocurrencies that follow this design(mining) are YFL and Dogecoin. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The impact mining has is a lot of physical electronic waste, high voltage of electricity usage. Typically the amount of power used in a single Bitcoin transaction is well over 2,2 kilowatt hours. This amount of electricity can power a typical US household for 78 days or rather 2 months and +-3 weeks. Now bearing mind that in some countries like the USA
        Burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, worsening climate change. Well I guess wealth generation can also have a toe on the environment, doesn't it?
    </p>
    <p> 
        Contrary to mining, the crypto space was introduced to ICO (initial coin offering) these tokens are pre-mined. The first to take advantage of this was Mastercoin in July 2013. And in 2014 July Ethereum raised money with a token sale , raising about 31,000 BTC or approximately $18.3 million at that time. Then in 2017 ICO gained popularity , there were at least 18 websites tracking ICOs before mid-year. Now get this, in May of 2017 the new website Brave generated about $35 million in under 30 seconds. Then Kik(Canadian messaging app) followed and a few more after that. ICO coin sales worth $2.3 billion had been conducted during the year, more than ten times as much as in all of 2016. 
    </p>
    <p> While there is potential gain in ICOs , there are some disadvantages. Some of which include  ICO regulatory mechanisms are not fully implemented. Number of potential scams is very high, and some of those projects that are not scams tend to have low success rates.  SpaceBit, Dao and Paycoin are amongst some of the companies that failed and if the ICO project fails the tokens will lose value and become worthless. Now this has led to many teams moving towards more regulated approaches. 
    </p>
    <p> Financial security is the act of investing with the exception of a future return. Hence  SAFTs (simple agreement for future tokens) were created. SAFTs allow startup investors to convert their cash investment into equity at a point in the future. Which can be compared to simple agreement for future equity (SAFE). </p>
    <p>However some of the disadvantages the SAFT can face are a limit in  investors, since contracts are only available for accredited investors. With limit in reach too, meaing that expansion is very low.</p>
    <p>The next phenomenon IEO (initial Exchange Offering) launched October 31 2019 and IDO (initial DEX Offering), these models with unique improvements from ICO and IPO. as they originally came out as  decentralized ,more secure and more accessible. Binance Launchpad is the pioneering IEO platform that became mainstream in 2019. With many successful IEOs, such as BitTorrent, Celer Network and Fetch AI just to name a few. </p>
    <p>It has been stated that IEOs offer far more than ICOs , Project initiators can benefit from the marketing expertise of IEOs. This can help them to reach potential investors much more easily and promotes chances for legal projects to obtain the necessary funding. It appears that most investors prefer purchasing IEO tokens. If you are an investor with low risk tolerance or just simply looking for a lower risk. IEOs can help mitigate . </p>
    <p>Dutch Auction, as defined by Investopedia, “is a public offering auction structure in which the price of the offering is set after taking in all bids to determine the highest price at which the total offering can be sold. In this type of auction, investors place a bid for the amount they are willing to buy in terms of quantity and price.” It is one of the token models available in the crypto-world.With Dutch auction,a participant may place bids for a number of tokens they are interested in buying and they provide the  maximum amount they want to pay for a token. Furthermore, as a participant you are guaranteed an allocation if the you willing to pay is above the clearing price.</p>
    <p>However there are drawbacks, one those is , where a stock’s price may crash immediately after listing when investors who bid a higher price earlier learn that they may have miscalculated or ovebid. This drawback is known as the “winner's curse”. In addition Dutch Auction has less price control and there is increased investor risk.</p>
    <p>Now imagine being able to generate more crypto with crypto . Well this is basically what yield farmers do. While being discreet about their complicated strategies , they move their crytos around trying to chase the highest return.  
    While yield farming is one of the ways to maximize your return , it goes without saying that even the loss can be high, especially if you don't know what you are doing. One known risk in DeFi are smart contracts  as they may contain bugs. Whether or not the protocols are developed by small teams with limited budgets or even by reputable auditing firms, vulnerabilities and bugs are consistently discovered. This is due to the immutable nature of blockchain . Just in case you want to take a walk on the wild side, here are some of the platforms yield farmers use: Compound Finance, Synthetix, Aave and Uniswap.

    <p>Tokens are evolving  and NFT (non fungible tokens) are coming to play. Bitcoin and Etherium  hit new all-time highs. But that is not all Gaming and Mateverse (a digital universe built in a game like environment) also came up on top. And we see massive amounts of investments 
    going into them.  We also see an accelerating Bitcoin flow into DeFi and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) has more than doubled it’s supply from what it was a year ago. Tokens really play a vital role in the digital ecosystem. When reading about Metaverse, well there seem to be  some concerns around security and the wedge e that it will create between reality and the real world , further it may affect relationships.

    <p> <em>With what has already been launched in the crypto space I am fascinated to see what the DeFi revolution brings next.</em></p>
